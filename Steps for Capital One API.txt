5) Generating fake purchases
You can get all merchants in the database withdrawals
GET /merchants

And with each merchant, it will have a location! You just need to search merchant by ID from the purchase

When generating fake purchases, choose a merchant at random (or on purpose) and use that as merchant ID.
THen put a random amount with random date or whatever and post it.
